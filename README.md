## üöÄ Hi, I'm Kyle Ross
I'm an Analytics Manager who is super passionate about Data Analytics, I just genuinely think it is so cool.

I love using SQL, Python, Alteryx, Tableau (and whatever else I come across) to make my ideas into a reality for myself and my clients.

If it's worth doing twice it's worth automating or streamlining once. I find it so satisfying to take tasks that once took days and turn them into things that take a couple of hours or minutes. I'm always thinking about processes and improving them.
