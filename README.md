## Hi, I'm Kyle Ross

I'm a seasoned Australian Business Intelligence professional who likes to code. I take great satisfaction in solving difficult problems with lasting solutions that everyone can understand. I'm driven to constantly learn, improve and build.

You can see some of my projects here on Github, which demonstrate my approach to problems. Feel free to make use of any of it, and I'm always keen to chat if you want to reach out.
